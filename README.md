## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build process or dependencies required.

## Development

The application consists of three files:
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure with inline SVG icons
- `styles.css` - All styling (converted from the original React CSS)
- `script.js` - Vanilla JavaScript functionality (converted from React components)

## Deployment

This application can be deployed directly to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting service:

1. Upload all files to your repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. The application will be available at your GitHub Pages URL
